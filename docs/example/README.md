# Configuration files examples

## On-premise (bare-metal or virtual machine)

After nxs-backup installation to a server/virtual machine need to generate configuration as the config does not appear
automatically.

You can generate a configuration file by running nxs-backup with the ***generate*** command and the options:

* *-T*[*--backup-type*] (required, backup type)
* *-S*[*--storage-types*] (optional, map of storages),
* *-O*[*--out-path*] (optional, path to the generated conf file).
  This will generate a configuration file for the job and output the details. For example:

```bash
$ sudo nxs-backup generate -T mysql -S minio=s3 aws=s3 share=nfs dumps=scp

nxs-backup: Successfully generated '/etc/nxs-backup/conf.d/mysql.conf' configuration file!
```

nxs-backup configuration files are located in the */etc/nxs-backup/* directory by default. If these files do not exist,
you will be prompted to add them at the first startup.

The basic configuration has only the main configuration file *nxs-backup.conf* and an empty subdirectory *conf.d*, where
files with job descriptions should be stored (one file per job). All configuration files are in YAML format.
For more details, see [settings](/docs/settings/README.md).

You can find the example of on-premise config files [here](./on-premise/README.md).

### Testing of ConÔ¨Åguration

You can verify that the configuration is correct by running nxs-backup with the ***-t*** option and the optional
parameter *-c*/*--config* (the path to the main conf file). The program will process all configurations and display
error messages and then terminate:

```sh
$ sudo nxs-backup -t
The configuration is correct.
```

## Docker-compose

* create config file e.g. `nxs-backup.conf`
* fill in the file with correct [settings](/docs/settings/README.md)
* put at the same path as `docker-compose.yaml`
* pay your attention that nxs-backup in docker better to start on the same host where the backed up system is located
* run docker compose as it described in [quickstart](https://github.com/nixys/go-nxs-backup/blob/main/README.md#docker-compose)
* there is a working example [here](docker-compose/README.md)

$IMAGE_VERSION can be discovered on [releases page](https://github.com/nixys/go-nxs-backup/releases)

## Kubernetes

* fill up a `values.yaml` with correct nxs-backup [settings](/docs/settings/README.md) (see examples [here](kubernetes/README.md))
* perform actions described in [quickstart](https://github.com/nixys/go-nxs-backup/blob/main/README.md#kubernetes)
* check that application started correct and running:
    * connect to your kubernetes cluster
    * get cronjobs list:

      ```sh
      $ kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get cronjobs
      ```
      $NAMESPACE - namespace where you installed nxs-backup
    * check that nxs-backup exists in the list of cronjobs
